# Scenario Recommendations

We recommend that you design your identity and access management landscape around our reference architectures. Whether you are staring from scratch or want to migrate an existing solution, we provide a target architecture for what we believe is the best solution..

When you adopt SAP cloud products and integrate them into your system landscape, you choose an approach for identity access management \(IAM\). The approach you choose depends on the integration you want from the perspective of single sign-on, whether you have a unified, simple IAM landscape or whether you have a complex landscape in place.
