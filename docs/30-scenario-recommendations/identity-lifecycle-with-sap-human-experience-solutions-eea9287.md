# Identity Lifecycle with SAP Human Experience Solutions

In this identity lifecycle scenario, users are created in the SAP Cloud Identity Services out of worker records maintained in SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central. SAP SuccessFactors Human Experience Management \(HXM\) acts as worker-source for SAP Cloud Identity Services which is managing the users in SAP cloud applications.

SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central creates a user record for each employee. In case the user record is in scope for the replication \(specified by last deactivation and last modification\), it will be read from SAP SuccessFactors Employee Central and written to SAP Cloud Identity Services \(in short, Cloud Identity Services\). Identity Provisioning reads the record from the Success Factors SCIM API and writes it using the SCIM API of the Identity Directory. The following figure illustrates this landscape.

For existing customers, SAP SuccessFactors offers an upgrade scenario to integrate and leverage the Cloud Identity Services for an identity lifecycle and secure authentication. For more information about configuringSAP SuccessFactors with Cloud Identity Services, see [SAP SuccessFactors Integration Scenario](../60-integration-scenarios/sap-successfactors-integration-scenario-8ce83db.md).

During the creation of a user account, Cloud Identity Services assign and store a Global User ID for this identity. This Global User ID uniquely identifies a user across SAP business applications and services. Therefore, it replaces the need for a correlation of different external user identifiers. It is also possible to provide a Global User ID instead of using the one generated by the Cloud Identity Services. For more information, see [Global User ID in Integration Scenarios](../60-integration-scenarios/global-user-id-in-integration-scenarios-a04611d.md).

Once the users are available in the Identity Directory \(the SAP Cloud Identity Services persistency layer\), they are replicated to the target applications by Identity Provisioning. The provisioning can be triggered manually or via scheduled jobs. Identity Provisioning has dedicated [connectors](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_PROVISIONING/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/ab3f641552464c79b94d10b9205fd721.html) for various SAP target applications. The connectors are optimized for the SAP cloud applications and in many cases, they are already pre-configured as part of the [SAP bundled scenarios](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_PROVISIONING/f48e822d6d484fa5ade7dda78b64d9f5/5db6c8dcf7a347fe81e2a78c3df9ec50.html), making point to point connections obsolete.

Based on the user information received from Identity Provisioning, the SAP cloud applications create local users and store them in their local user store. The Global User ID provided by the Identity Provisioning as part of the user information is also stored locally and mapped to an internal ID the application might have created for a specific user.

## Integration with Identity Management Solutions

Many SAP customers already have an Identity Management solution in place. SAP SuccessFactors relies on the integration with the Cloud Identity Services. Moreover, a growing number of applications such as [SAP Task Center](https://help.sap.com/docs/TASK_CENTER?version=Cloud) or SAP Identity Access Governance, as well as SAP BTP аpplications that leverage the [Authorization Management Service](https://help.sap.com/docs/IDENTITY_AUTHENTICATION/6d6d63354d1242d185ab4830fc04feb1/982ac5f91d2346fda8dd8096e861fc36.html), require them as well.

SAP customers often maintain the user and group distribution through point-to-point custom connections. In this case, the Identity Access Management administrator is responsible for creating and maintaining the custom point-to-point connections to the target applications. Any changes that might come regarding provisioning to target SAP SaaS applications could mean extra effort at the customer side.

To get advantage of the default integration of SAP SuccessFactors with Cloud Identity Services while fulfilling the requirement to have a central Identity Management solution, we propose the reference architecture illustrated in the following figure.

  
  
**Integrated SAP HXM, SAP Cloud Identity Services landscape with a central Identity Management solution**

SAP SuccessFactors acts as source application for the employee identity. The Identity Management solution gets newly created users from the Identity Directory and appends additional information based on the established processes like authorization assignments or attributes. The result of those processes is then distributed to on-premises systems via the existing integrations.

Users are provisioned to SAP cloud applications by Identity Provisioning based on the updated user record in the SAP Cloud Identity Services persistency layer. Some identity information \(for example, the Global User ID\) must be provisioned back to SAP SuccessFactors. This approach eliminates the need to maintain custom connections and leverages predefined integration scenarios for the cloud solutions with the established Identity Management processes.
